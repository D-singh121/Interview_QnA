1. ## What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a container-centric infrastructure where applications can be deployed, managed, and scaled efficiently in a cluster environment.

2. ## Explain Kubernetes architecture?
Kubernetes architecture consists of a control plane and nodes. The control plane manages the Kubernetes cluster and its state, while nodes are the machines (physical or virtual) where containers run.

Control Plane Components:

API Server: Acts as the front-end for Kubernetes. It validates and processes REST operations and updates state in etcd.
etcd: Consistent and highly-available key-value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.
Scheduler: Assigns nodes to newly created pods based on resource requirements and other constraints.
Controller Manager: Runs controllers that regulate the state of the cluster, such as node controllers, replication controllers, and endpoint controllers.

Node Components:
kubelet: An agent that runs on each node and ensures containers are running in a Pod.
kube-proxy: Maintains network rules on nodes and performs connection forwarding.
Container Runtime: Software responsible for running containers, such as Docker or containerd.
